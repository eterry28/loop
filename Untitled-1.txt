Tropico: "Viva, El Presidente!!"
Review By: Eric Terry
PopTop Software has delivered exactly what players of Maxis' 'SimCity' have wanted since the series started an insight to the citizens' wants and needs. "Tropico" is a perfect blend between 'The Sims' and 'SimCity'. Sure it�s nice to have a bar graph indicating that more residential areas and less industrial zones are needed. Why stop there?

Max Payne: "Bringin' the Payne"
Review By: Eric Terry
Max Payne is a story-driven 3rd person action game aimed for a mature audience. Two camera modes show the grim present day New York City setting and the gunplay action from the best possible angles. The follow-up mode tails Max Payne, as he runs, his guns blazing and his long leather jacket flapping, through trash littered alleys and cockroach crawling hotel rooms. The cinematic camera provides "director's cut" pre-set views to dramatic scenes, be it in a deep-shadowed slum, or in an all sleek and sexy art deco skyscraper.
